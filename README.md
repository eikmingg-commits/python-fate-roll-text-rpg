A text-based Python program where the player encounters an unknown entity and experiences suspense through a dynamic fate roll system. This project explores early experimentation with Python, game loops, conditional logic, and text-based storytelling.

   Features:
- **Typewriter effect:** Text is displayed slowly for dramatic effect.
- **Thinking dots animation:** Suspenseful ellipses appear to simulate the Entity “thinking.”
- **Random fate rolls:** A random number (1–100) determines the outcome.
- **Conditional outcomes:** Different messages depending on the roll, including critical fate, calm threads, rare events, and even death.

   Future Ideas:
- Expand into a mini RPG with multiple enemies and actions.
- Add more complex outcomes based on combined rolls and player choices.
- Include inventory, spells, or interactive dialogue branchess.
